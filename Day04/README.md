# Day 4 Project: Rock Paper Scissors

It's game that we can play with the computer.

So the game starts out by asking you to type 0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors.

Then it's going to show you a graphic of your choice, and then the choice the computer made. A

What this game boils down to is some way of randomly making a choice between rock, paper, or scissors 
and then comparing that choice that the computer randomly generated against your choice.

And then based on the rules of rock, paper, and scissors, determining whether if you won, you lost or
whether if you had a draw.
