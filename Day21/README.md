# Day 21 Project: Snake Game Part 2

Step 4. Detect collision with food

Step 5. Create a scoreboard

Step 6. Detect collision with wall

Step 7. Detect collision with tail

It is a game where you control the snake using keyboard, and you can go and get food, 
and then it grows in length as it eats more food.

And you have to make sure that you don't end up getting tangled or hitting the wall.

And the goal is to eat as much food as you can while staying alive.
