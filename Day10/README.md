# Day 10 Project: Calculator

It's a simple text base calculator that supports plus, minus, multiply 
or divide operations.

It asks you to write the first number, then pick one of the operations 
and also write the second number.

Then it shows the full calculation, for example: 5 / 2 = 2.5.

And now you can continue calculating with the answer from the previous step,
or we type 'n' to start a new calculation.
