# Day 16 Project: OOP Coffee Machine

It's a project that presents OOP version of coffee machine.

The program still has the same requirements as in Day 15 Project.

It has to print reports for all resources, check if the resources are sufficient,
process coins, check transaction is successful and finally make coffee.

But in this case, it's working with objects.
