# Day 5 Project: Password Generator

Program ask you how many letters, symbols and numbers would you like in your password. 

Then it's going to generate two different passwords:

* The first password is easy, so order of characters is not randomised.
* The second password is more difficult, so order of characters is randomized.

Password can consist all the letters in the alphabet from A to Z, including the uppercase and lowercase letters. And also all digits and some symbols.
