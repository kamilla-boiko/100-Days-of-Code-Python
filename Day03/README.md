# Day 3 Project: Treasure Island

It's an adventure game.

So it starts off asking you, you're at a crossroad. Do you want to go left or right?

If you selected left, then it's going to take you to a lake, and it asks you whether if you want to wait for a boat or swim across.

So let's go ahead and wait for a boat. 

And then the final step is it asks you which door would you like to go through? Red, yellow or blue.

Now, depending on your choice, you'll either end up with game over or you'll end up with winning the game.
