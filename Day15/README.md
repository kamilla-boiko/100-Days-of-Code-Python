# Day 15 Project: Coffee Machine

It's a project that presents virtual coffee machine.

The first step - it's ask which flavor do you want: espresso, latte or cappuccino. 
We have the recipes for these three types of drinks. Each of them requires a different 
quantity of water, a different quantity of coffee and a different quantity of milk.
And they also each half a different price.

In addition, the coffee machine has some resources that it has to manage.
The second feature of our coffee machine is that it's coin operated.

We need our coffee machine to be able to print a report. It needs to be able to tell us 
what resources it has left, how much water has left, how much milk, etc.

In addition to being able to print a report, we also want to be able to check that the 
resources are sufficient when the user orders a drink.

If it's possible, it asks to insert some coins.

If amount of money is enough, it gives the change and the drink.
Otherwise, it refunds the money and doesn't give a drink.
