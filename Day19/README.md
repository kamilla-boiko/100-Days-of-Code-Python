# Day 19 Project: Turtle Race

More about turtle graphics using event listeners, higher order functions, state and multiple instances of an object.

Here are represent two games:

1 - Etch-a-Sketch. This game allows to use the up and down arrows to move turtle forwards and back and 
use right and left to turn turtle clockwise and anticlockwise to continue drawing.

2 - Turtle racing game. You can bet on the color of a turtle who will win the race. And then once click okay to the popup,
then all of turtles go to the starting line and they start moving at a random pace.
And then once the first turtle hits the right edge of the screen, it will be declared the winner and we will get to see if our turtle won or not.
