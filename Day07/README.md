# Day 7 Project: Hangman

It's a game, where you have to guess a word and for every wrong letter you submit,
you end up taking a life away from this little man. 

The longer it takes you to get to the word, the more you put your little man in danger.

So this is what the completed game looks like and how it plays out.
