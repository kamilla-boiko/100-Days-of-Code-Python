# Day 12 Project: Number Guessing Game

It's a game where you need to guess the number which the computer chose.

The first thing it tells is Welcome. And then it tells it's thinking of a number
between 1 and 100, and then you get to choose a difficulty: easy or hard.

Then it tells you amount of attempts to guess the number, for easy it's 10 and for hard it's 5.

After guessing the number, it tells that chosen number is lower or higher.
