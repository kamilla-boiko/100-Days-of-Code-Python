# Day 20 Project: Snake Game Part 1

Step 1. Create a snake body

Step 2. Move the snake

Step 3. Control the snake

It is a game where you control the snake using keyboard, and you can go and get food, 
and then it grows in length as it eats more food.

And you have to make sure that you don't end up getting tangled or hitting the wall.

And the goal is to eat as much food as you can while staying alive.
