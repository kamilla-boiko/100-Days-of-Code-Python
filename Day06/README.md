# Day 6 Project: Escaping the Maze

The goal is to write code in Reeborg's world, 
to be able to get the little robot 
to be able to navigate to the goal and 
go through a maze no matter what the maze look like.

We have a maze. And even though the maze doesn't change,  the robot does. 

The direction that the robot is going to face is completely
random, the position of the robot is also random.
