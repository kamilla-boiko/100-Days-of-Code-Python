# Day 9 Project: Blind Auction Program

It's a program that is a type of auction called a silent auction where everybody 
bids silently and no one knows the other person's bids until at the very end of 
the auction where the highest bid is revealed. 

So it asked bidder name and bidding price. When you are done with your bid, 
it asked whether if there are any other bidders.

So if you type a yes then the screen clears and you can handover the laptop to
the next person who's going to make their bid.

If everybody is done, then we type no, and it's going to now tally up all the bids 
and figure out who bid the highest and give a winner.
