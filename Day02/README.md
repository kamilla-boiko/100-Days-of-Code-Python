# Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator

It's a tip calculator. 
So the final output is going to look like this.

It's going to ask you for an input for how much the total bill came to.

Then it'll ask you what percentage tip would you like to give.

And then it asks how many people are splitting this bill.

Finally, it's going to tell us that each person should pay.
